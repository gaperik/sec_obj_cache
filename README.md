=============

This is about discussing requirements and possible solutions for delivering content to web clients in a secure and efficient manner while still allowing for a service provider to leverage application level proxies/gateways for content delivery.

This starts as an exploration with mainly high level stuff and few details with the intention of securing understanding and consensus on goals, motivations, requirements and solutions before letting the 'rubber hit the asphalt', i.e. build something.

Building is of course necessary and assumed to be done as well.
